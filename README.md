# PreyPredatorModel

## Abstract :

In this study, we propose a two prey-predator model incorporated strong and weak **Allee effect** in prey population with **Bedington-Deangelis** type functional response. A detailed mathematical analysis of the model has been done. In particular, **boundedness, permanence, local stability and Hopf-bifurcation** for
the system have been conducted. We have included both strong and weak Allee effect in our model and corresponding results from previous well known predatorâ€“prey models are compared with the current findings. It is shown that species in the model with strong Allee effect become extinct beyond a threshold value of Allee parameter at low density of prey population, whereas species never become extinct in weak Allee effect if they are initially present.Numerical simulation done on the model done on the model show that it is in agreement with the theoratical analysis. Finally, an extended discussion of the ecological implications of the analytical and numerical results concludes the paper.
